abstract: >-
  The purity of tissue samples can affect the accuracy and utility of DNA
  methylation array analyses. This is particularly important for the placenta
  which is globally hypomethylated compared to other tissues. Placental villous
  tissue from early pregnancy terminations can be difficult to separate from
  non-villous tissue, resulting in potentially inaccurate results. We used
  several methods to identify mixed placenta samples using DNA methylation array
  datasets from our laboratory and those contained in the NCBI GEO database,
  highlighting the importance of determining sample purity during quality
  control processes.
