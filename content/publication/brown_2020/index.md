abstract: >-
  There has been much interest in the ability of regulatory T cells (Treg) to
  switch function in vivo, either as a result of genetic risk of disease or in
  response to environmental and metabolic cues. The relationship between levels
  of FOXP3 and functional fitness plays a significant part in this plasticity.
  There is an emerging role for Treg in tissue repair that may be less dependent
  on FOXP3, and the molecular mechanisms underpinning this are not fully
  understood. As a result of detailed, high-resolution functional genomics, the
  gene regulatory networks and key functional mediators of Treg phenotype
  downstream of FOXP3 have been mapped, enabling a mechanistic insight into Treg
  function. This transcription factor-driven programming of T-cell function to
  generate Treg requires the switching on and off of key genes that form part of
  the Treg gene regulatory network and raises the possibility that this is
  reversible. It is plausible that subtle shifts in expression levels of
  specific genes, including transcription factors and non-coding RNAs, change
  the regulation of the Treg gene network. The subtle skewing of gene expression
  initiates changes in function, with the potential to promote chronic disease
  and/or to license appropriate inflammatory responses. In the case of
  autoimmunity, there is an underlying genetic risk, and the interplay of
  genetic and environmental cues is complex and impacts gene regulation networks
  frequently involving promoters and enhancers, the regulatory elements that
  control gene expression levels and responsiveness. These promoterâ€“enhancer
  interactions can operate over long distances and are highly cell type
  specific. In autoimmunity, the genetic risk can result in changes in these
  enhancer/promoter interactions, and this mainly impacts genes which are
  expressed in T cells and hence impacts Treg/conventional T-cell (Tconv)
  function. Genetic risk may cause the subtle alterations to the responsiveness
  of gene regulatory networks which are controlled by or control FOXP3 and its
  target genes, and the application of assays of the 3D organization of
  chromatin, enabling the connection of non-coding regulatory regions to the
  genes they control, is revealing the direct impact of
  environmental/metabolic/genetic risk on T-cell function and is providing
  mechanistic insight into susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune
  conditions.
